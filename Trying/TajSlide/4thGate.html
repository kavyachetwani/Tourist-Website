        The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631. It is often considered the ultimate symbol of love.
The exterior walls of the Taj Mahal are adorned with intricate calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran, executed in beautiful Persian calligraphy by skilled artisans.
It took 22 years to complete, from 1632 to 1653, and involved over 20,000 workers and craftsmen.
